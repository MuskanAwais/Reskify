# SWMSprint Files to Copy

Please copy these specific files from your SWMSprint app and paste them here:

## 1. Main PDF Generation Component
**File: `client/src/components/swms-generator.tsx`**
- This is the main SWMS generator component
- Copy the entire file content

## 2. Document Preview Component  
**File: `client/src/components/document-preview.tsx`**
- Handles document preview functionality
- Copy the entire file content

## 3. SWMS Form Component
**File: `client/src/components/swms-form.tsx`** 
- Main form handling component
- Copy the entire file content

## 4. Backend API Routes
**File: `server/routes.ts`**
- Contains PDF generation endpoints
- Copy the entire file content

## 5. Package Dependencies
**File: `package.json`**
- Need to see the exact dependencies for PDF generation
- Copy the entire file content

## Priority Order:
1. Start with `server/routes.ts` (backend PDF generation)
2. Then `client/src/components/swms-generator.tsx` (main component)
3. Then `package.json` (dependencies)

Once you paste these files, I'll integrate the exact SWMSprint code into your Riskify app, replacing the external connection with the actual functionality running internally.
