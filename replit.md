## Changelog

- July 1, 2025. Fixed AI Generation Trade Specificity Issue - Resolved critical problem where AI was generating irrelevant construction tasks (excavation, concrete, steel work) for specific trade jobs like "tiling a DDA bathroom". Enhanced AI prompts to be trade-specific with clear restrictions against generic construction activities. Added explicit examples and improved system instructions to focus only on tasks directly related to the specified trade and job description. AI now generates 6-8 relevant tasks for tiling work (surface prep, waterproofing, tile installation, grouting) instead of unrelated construction activities. Prevents user confusion and ensures SWMS documents contain only applicable safety procedures for the actual work being performed.
- July 1, 2025. Fixed SWMS Auto-Save Document Creation Logic - Resolved critical issue where SWMS builder was either overwriting latest draft (preventing multiple documents) or creating new document on every keystroke (causing document spam). Implemented proper session-based draft management: when starting new SWMS, first save creates new document and sets session draftId, subsequent saves update same document during session. When accessing SWMS builder fresh (no edit parameter), starts with null draftId ensuring new document creation. Auto-save and manual save now work cohesively - create once per session, then update that document. Cleaned up test database removing 12 duplicate documents. System now correctly handles: new SWMS creation (separate documents), within-session editing (updates same document), and explicit draft editing via URL parameter (updates specific draft). Perfect balance between document separation and session persistence.
- July 1, 2025. Dashboard & Recycling Bin UI Improvements - Fixed dashboard API to display real user data (credits and SWMS counts) instead of zeros by correcting field mapping to use swmsCredits and proper user ID (999). Enhanced recycling bin interface by removing shield icon, replacing with MapPin for location display, adding 30-day auto-deletion notice with amber alert styling, improved card formatting with better spacing and hover effects, and fixed restore functionality to properly switch back to active tab when documents are restored. Restore API route corrected from /api/swms/restore/{id} to /api/swms/{id}/restore to match server implementation. Recycling bin now shows professional deletion notice and provides clear visual feedback for restoration workflow.
- July 1, 2025. Fixed PDF Download RiskTemplateBuilder Integration & Auto-Document Creation - Updated PDF download in My SWMS to use RiskTemplateBuilder exclusively with comprehensive data mapping (85+ fields) ensuring downloaded PDFs match live preview exactly. Fixed critical SWMS creation issue where new documents were overriding existing drafts instead of creating separate files. Modified storage logic to only update drafts when explicitly editing via draftId parameter, allowing multiple SWMS documents per user. Removed "New SWMS" button as SWMS builder now automatically creates new documents when accessed directly. Added recycling bin functionality with 30-day auto-deletion for deleted SWMS documents. Enhanced My SWMS interface with simplified button structure - completed SWMS show Download/Delete only, drafts show Edit/Delete only. System now properly creates individual SWMS documents without file override issues while maintaining exact PDF generation consistency through RiskTemplateBuilder integration.
- July 1, 2025. Comprehensive Construction Safety Analytics Implementation - Built complete analytics system with 8 specialized categories: Daily/Weekly Activity Patterns (when SWMS created most often), Most Common Hazards (top hazards from actual project data), High-Risk Construction Work frequency (HRCW categories from WHS Regulations), Location Analysis (most common work sites), Equipment Usage Patterns (frequently specified plant/equipment), PPE Requirements Analysis (common safety equipment combinations), Document Completeness Scoring (quality assessment), and Review/Update Frequency tracking. Enhanced API with sophisticated data analysis algorithms extracting insights from workActivities, hrcwCategories, plantEquipment, ppeRequirements, and project locations. Created comprehensive dashboard with 12 interactive charts including bar charts for daily patterns, line charts for trends, horizontal bar charts for locations, progress bars for hazard frequency, pie charts for risk distribution, and quality metrics cards. All analytics use authentic user-specific data (3 documents for user 999) providing meaningful construction safety insights without placeholder content.
- June 30, 2025. Signature Box Implementation & Live Dashboard Integration - Added comprehensive signature functionality to SWMS builder with upload image and type name options under "Person Creating and Authorising SWMS" section.
