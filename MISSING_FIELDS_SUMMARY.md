## üö® ACTION REQUIRED

**For your RiskTemplateBuilder app to receive ALL data from Riskify:**

1. **Add signature fields** to your PDF template (most important)
2. **Add additional project fields** for complete project information
3. **Add safety/emergency fields** for comprehensive emergency planning
4. **Add high-risk work fields** for regulatory compliance

**All these fields are now being sent** from Riskify - your RiskTemplateBuilder just needs to handle them in the template.

**Current endpoint:** `https://risktemplatebuilder--3000.prod1a.defang.dev/api/generate-pdf`

**System status:** ‚úÖ No fallback - exclusively uses your RiskTemplateBuilder app
