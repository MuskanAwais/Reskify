1. Project and Document Details
	•	Project name, location, and description
	•	Principal contractor and subcontractor name
	•	ABN, licence number (if applicable)
	•	SWMS document version number and date
	•	Person(s) responsible for ensuring compliance with SWMS on site
	•	Signature section (prepared by / reviewed by / approved by)

⸻

2. High-Risk Construction Work (HRCW) Identification

Clearly state if the work involves any of the 18 high-risk activities under WHS Regulation 291, such as:
	•	Work at heights above 2m
	•	Work near live electrical installations
	•	Demolition or structural alterations
	•	Asbestos-related work
	•	Confined spaces, etc.

⚠️ You must specify why the work is classified as high-risk and which regulation(s) apply.

⸻

3. Work Activity Breakdown

Each work activity or task must include:
	•	Task title (e.g. “Use of power tools”, “Installation of suspended ceiling”)
	•	Description of the task
	•	Step-by-step breakdown (to allow for proper risk identification)

⸻

4. Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment

For each step or activity, list:
	•	Associated hazards (e.g. sharp tools, slips, working at heights)
	•	Potential risks (e.g. lacerations, falls, electric shock)

There’s no hard rule on quantity, but 2–6 risks per task is typical for medium-complexity activities. Ensure:
	•	All reasonably foreseeable hazards are addressed
	•	Include site-specific risks where relevant

⸻

5. Risk Control Measures (The Hierarchy of Control)

For each identified hazard, include:
	•	Controls listed in order of hierarchy: Elimination > Substitution > Engineering > Isolation > Admin > PPE
	•	Multiple controls may apply to a single risk

✅ Your generator should default to engineering or elimination first, then drop down the hierarchy if others aren’t practical.

⸻

6. Plant, Equipment and Materials Used

Include:
	•	Specific tools/machinery to be used
	•	Manufacturer recommendations
	•	Pre-start inspection requirements

⸻

7. PPE Requirements

List specific PPE for each task:
	•	Hard hats, gloves, safety boots, eye protection, hearing protection, etc.

Make this context-sensitive depending on the risk level and task type.

⸻

8. Training, Competency and Permits
	•	Required licences (e.g. High-Risk Work Licence)
	•	Evidence of training (white card, task-specific competency)
	•	Induction records
	•	Any permits required (confined space, hot works, electrical isolation)

⸻

9. Emergency Procedures
	•	Response plan for likely incidents (e.g. injury, fall, fire)
	•	Nearest hospital and emergency contact numbers
	•	Site-specific first aid arrangements

⸻

10. Review and Monitoring
	•	Process for reviewing and updating the SWMS
	•	Site supervisor sign-off
	•	Toolbox talks / pre-start briefings
