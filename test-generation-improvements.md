# SWMS Generation and Mobile Layout Improvements

## Changes Implemented

### 1. AI Generation Improvements
- **Increased token limit**: 2000 → 4000 tokens to prevent JSON truncation
- **Optimized prompt**: Reduced verbose instructions, focused on 5-8 tasks minimum
- **Enhanced JSON parsing**: Robust error handling with content extraction fallbacks
- **Better construction relevance**: More lenient keyword matching for trade-specific content

### 2. Mobile Layout Fixes
- **Responsive task cards**: Converted fixed grid layouts to flexible mobile-first design
- **Improved spacing**: Better padding and margins for touch interfaces
- **Responsive text sizes**: Smaller text on mobile, larger on desktop
- **Flexible layout**: Stack elements vertically on mobile, horizontal on desktop
- **Better tag display**: Increased tag limits and improved wrapping

### 3. Security System Improvements
- **Input sanitization**: Comprehensive content filtering and validation
- **Output monitoring**: Real-time security alerts and content logging
- **Admin dashboard**: Complete security monitoring with statistics and alerts
- **Construction relevance**: Enhanced keyword detection for trade-specific content

## Expected Results
- Generation should produce 5-8 tasks instead of 3
- Mobile display should show properly spaced, readable content
- No more JSON parsing errors from truncated responses
- Security system should allow valid construction content while blocking inappropriate content
