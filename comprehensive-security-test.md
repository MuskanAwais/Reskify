  - Profanity and inappropriate content filtering
  - Spam pattern detection (repetitive characters, excessive capitals)
  - Non-construction content detection
  - HTML/Script injection protection
  - SQL injection pattern detection
  - Risk level assessment (low/medium/high)

### 2. Output Monitoring System

- **Features**:
  - Content logging for all AI generations
  - Security alert creation and management
  - Unusual pattern detection (rate limiting, repetitive content)
  - Construction relevance checking
  - User activity tracking
  - Risk level statistics

### 3. Security Monitoring Dashboard
- **Location**: `client/src/pages/admin/security-monitoring.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Real-time security statistics display
  - Active alerts management
  - Content logs with filtering and search
  - Risk distribution visualization
  - Alert resolution system

### 4. Integration Points
