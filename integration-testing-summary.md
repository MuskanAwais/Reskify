## Integration Architecture

### Data Flow
1. User inputs form data in SWMS builder
2. 500ms debounce timer prevents excessive updates
3. Form data transformed to API format
4. postMessage sent to embedded RiskTemplateBuilder
5. Preview updates in real-time with new data

### Message Structure
```javascript
{
  type: 'FORM_DATA_UPDATE',
  data: {
    // Project details
    jobName, jobNumber, projectAddress,
    swmsCreatorName, swmsCreatorPosition,
    principalContractor, projectManager, siteSupervisor,
    
    // Company branding
    companyLogo,
    
    // SWMS content
    selectedActivities, selectedHRCW, selectedPPE,
    equipment, emergencyProcedures,
    
    // Metadata
    preview: true
  }
}
```

### Field Mapping Coverage
- 15+ project information fields
- Unlimited work activities with risk assessments
- 18 HRCW categories (WHS Regulations 2011)
- 25+ PPE requirement options
- Equipment specifications with risk levels
- Emergency procedures and contact details
- Digital signature integration ready

## Known Limitations

1. **Network Dependency**: Requires stable connection to RiskTemplateBuilder app
2. **Cross-Origin Restrictions**: Some advanced features limited by browser security
3. **Mobile Performance**: Large forms may impact performance on low-memory devices
4. **Offline Capability**: No offline preview functionality
